# Fake News Classification Using NLP

This project aims to classify news articles as either **fake** or **factual** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. By leveraging computational methods to analyze textual data, the system identifies patterns that distinguish fake news from factual news.

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to:
- Understand human language.
- Interpret and analyze textual or spoken data.
- Perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation, text classification, and more.

In this project, NLP techniques are applied to the problem of distinguishing fake news from factual news.

## Workflow for Fake News Classification

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Before analyzing the text, preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the data:
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words or sentences.
- **Removing Stopwords:** Excluding common words like "and," "the," etc., that do not add significant meaning.
- **Lemmatization/Stemming:** Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

### 2. Feature Extraction
The cleaned text is transformed into numerical representations for the model:
- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Counting the frequency of words in the text.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Measuring word importance relative to the entire dataset.
- **Word Embeddings:** Representing words as vectors that capture context and semantic meaning (e.g., using techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT).

### 3. Model Building
Supervised machine learning models are used to classify the text:
- Classical ML models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**.
- Advanced models such as deep learning techniques, including **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)**, or **Transformer models** like **BERT**.

### 4. Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified articles.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results out of all positive results.
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall.

## Real-Life Application
This project demonstrates a practical use case for NLP:

- **Fake News Detection:**
  - The model analyzes linguistic patterns in articles.
  - It identifies characteristics common in fabricated stories, such as overly sensational language or lack of credible sources.
  - Articles that align with reliable journalistic styles and credible references are classified as factual.

- **Automated Fact-Checking:**
  - This system can assist fact-checking organizations by providing automated insights into the credibility of news articles.

## Conclusion
By combining the power of NLP techniques and machine learning models, this project showcases a robust framework for classifying news articles as fake or factual. It provides a foundation for further advancements in automated fact-checking systems and combating misinformation.
